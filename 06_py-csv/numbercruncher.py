DISCO:
  * Parsing a csv file with "with open('___.csv', 'r') as ___"
  * We put the data into prefix so that it's easier to determine what percent range it has
  
QCC:
  * what does the 'r' mean in the "with open() as ' method

  
HOW THIS SCRIPT WORKS:
1. Open the cvs file using the method with open("file_name") as ""
2. Input the data from the csv file into the dictionary
3. Order the dictioanry file into prefix form
4. Randomly generate a number from 0 to 100
5. Select the occupation based on the randomly generated number
6. Checked our solution by running randomOccupation 50000 times
